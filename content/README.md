## Before You Begin

Please note that examples of expected output have in some places been truncated or abbreviated to better fit narrow screen widths. These examples are rough guides only; if you see more information in your terminal than in the text, that is expected.

### Exercises:

<!--*Scroll down for Windows-native exercises*-->

**New to Bash?** See the appendix *A Brief Introduction to Bash* for a very brief tour of most of the bash commands we'll use in this workshop.

<!-- **Windows Users doing Linux-based exercises**: Please note that in all exercises we will use Unix style paths using forward slashes (‘/‘) instead of backslashes (‘\‘). On Windows you can work directly with such paths by either using a **Bash** terminal or a **Powershell** terminal. Powershell can work with both Windows and Unix style paths. -->
